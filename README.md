# Heraldry

A little site to help you make heraldries for the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K.
You can use it on the hosted instance available at: https://heraldry.deno.dev

### Local development

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```

```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
